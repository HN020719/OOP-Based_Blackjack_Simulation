# OOP-Based_Blackjack_Simulation
In this project, we developed a fully functional Blackjack game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game was designed with modularity in mind, breaking down the functionality into separate Python files for better organization and maintainability. The components of the game include:

- **Card:** Represents a single playing card.
- **Deck:** Manages a collection of cards, including operations like shuffling.
- **Hand:** Represents a player's hand of cards, allowing for operations such as adding a card and calculating the hand's value.
- **Shuffle:** Handles the shuffling logic for the deck.

These components were then integrated into the main game logic within `blackjack.py`, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easy readability. The use of OOP allowed us to create a clean and efficient codebase, making the game extensible and easy to understand.
